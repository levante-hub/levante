## UX Guidelines — Levante

### Principles
- Clarity: plain language, no technical jargon.
- Guidance: wizards and empty‑states with examples.
- Control: confirmations for costly or permissioned actions (MCP).

### Patterns
- Clean centered chat, visible actions (regenerate, stop, quote).
- Accessible model selector; tooltips with estimated cost/latency.
- Unified text search with filters by session/date.
